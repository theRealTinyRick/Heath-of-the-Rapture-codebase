To properly use the player stats that I wrote: 

To use stamina you should set up a button like LeftShift for stamina use like this:
Some where on the player where we handle input>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

In the GameManager I wrote a save and load script for player stats(We can repurpose this for other stuff too)
From that script we call the function PlayerStats.LoadStats to further prevent any script from the 
outside of this file from dirtectly altering the values. This uses the class PlayerData(again we can expand the purpose of this class);

PlayerStats stats;
if(input.GetKey(LeftShift)){
    stats.useStamina = true;
}else(
    stats.useStamina = false;
)

the above code will use stamina over time for a sprint or something like that. 
if you would like to suddenly use alot of stamina use:

PlayerStats stats;
stats.UseStamina;

Other functions are as follows:

DealDamage(float dmg);
Heal(float healAmt);
HealOverTime(healOverTimeAmount); //it is defaulted to 5

The class PlayerHealth is not done. We can expand it by applying resistances to damage and what not. 
that is the purpose on the calculate damage.
